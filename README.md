# learn-online-grails
Web application built using Groovy on Rails (Grails). It manages a database of students and courses and renders the content on HTML, using Bootstrap to give style to the web pages.

Users can see the lists of all courses/users present on the database; there are also detail views of courses and users. Furthermore, it is possible for the users to enroll or drop courses and this data will be updated on the database.

There is a login on the index page so the users have to provide their username and password to log in. A sample username and password to test the application is: username = jlamber4, password = password1
